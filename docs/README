Introduction
------------

Speedy Whois allows you to create your own whois website in minutes.  It 
is based on the phpWhois class.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

Requirements
------------

phpWhois requires PHP 4.3.0 or better with OpenSSL support to work 
properly.  Without SSL support you will not be able to query domains 
which do not have a whois server but that have a https based whois. 
Also, you can run it in lower PHP versions but without timeout control. 
phpWhois will not work with PHP versions below 4.1.0.

If you have a firewall, open port 43 (whois) for outgoing connections.

Installation
------------

Unzip this package into your website.  The files under the main 
directory of this package (index.php) should be under the document root.
The rest of the files you can move if you want to, as long as you change
the includes in index.php.  You can also keep these files under the
document root, there are no known problems or security risks.

When everything works, feel free to change whatever you like, including
the name of your whois website.  It's free software!  Of course you can
link to www.speedywhois.net if you want to, but you don't have to.
